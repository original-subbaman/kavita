# Kavita

Kavita is my attempt to create a small social platform where poets can share their poetry and connect with fellow writers.

## Technology Used

- Built with React and Vite.
- Tailwind CSS / MUI for modern and responsive styling.
- Framer Motion for animations.
- Supabase integration for backend services.
- Deployed on AWS Amplify.

## Features

- Create and share your own poems, follow talented poets, and engage with the community through likes and thoughtful comments.
- Curate your personal "Inspiration Wall" by capturing and saving evocative language from fellow poets, fueling your own creative journey.
- Discover poetry by theme, making it easy to explore new styles, moods, and voices that resonate with you.
